# arheadsetkit-dev

This repository is for exploring the feasibility of "ARHeadsetKit 2.0", rewriting ARHeadsetKit from the ground up. The driving use case is an interactive design environment for [molecular nanotechnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_nanotechnology), building on my work in [molecular-renderer](https://github.com/philipturner/molecular-renderer). This is the perfect application for AR - physically grabbing atoms and placing them, immersing yourself in the nanostructure. Rendering the MD simulation with a speed adjusted for scaling laws, to show how it's just as fast as macroscale mechanical machines.

However, this is hypothetical, and there is no guarantee I will update ARHeadsetKit. If the update does happen, it will be in the far future. For questions or concerns, please open an issue in the main [ARHeadsetKit](https://github.com/philipturner/arheadsetkit) repository.

New README draft

ARHeadsetKit is a game engine that creates immersive [augmented reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality) (AR) experiences on affordable hardware. It goes beyond the conventional handheld AR, and emulates [smart glasses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartglasses). Headset AR - as opposed to "handheld" AR - is like a virtual reality headset, but also incorporates information from the real world. With good enough graphics, it can be hard to distinguish _reality_ from _reality as displayed inside the headset_. This means headset AR can inject virtual objects into (what we perceive as) the real world. The headset could be a sleek pair of glasses, a $3,000 industrial HoloLens, or your smartphone's [OLED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED) display. The applications are endless, but unrealized.

Headset AR became possible\* in 2020, with the iPhone 12 Pro's LiDAR scanner. This scanner captures the world in 3D using somethign like radar and sonar. Paired with a powerful GPU and a cheap DIY VR headset, this scanner can replicate $3,000 Microsoft HoloLens or Apple's future headset. However, ARHeadsetKit costs $0 and you can try it now.

> \*Possible for the average person.

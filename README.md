# arheadsetkit-dev

This repository is for exploring the feasibility of "ARHeadsetKit 2.0", rewriting ARHeadsetKit from the ground up. The driving use case is an interactive design environment for [molecular nanotechnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_nanotechnology), building on my work in [molecular-renderer](https://github.com/philipturner/molecular-renderer). This is the perfect application for AR - physically grabbing atoms and placing them, immersing yourself in the nanostructure. Rendering the MD simulation with a speed adjusted for scaling laws, to show how it's just as fast as macroscale mechanical machines.

However, this is hypothetical, and there is no guarantee I will update ARHeadsetKit. If the update does happen, it will be in the far future. For questions or concerns, please open an issue in the main [ARHeadsetKit](https://github.com/philipturner/arheadsetkit) repository.

New README

ARHeadsetKit is a game engine that creates immersive AR experiences on affordable hardware. It goes beyond the conventional handheld AR, and emulates smart glasses. Headset AR (as opposed to "handheld" AR) became possible in 2020, with the iPhone 12 Pro's LiDAR scanner. This scanner captures the world in 3D using a technique similar to radar and sonar. Paired with a powerful GPU and a cheap DIY virtual reality headset, this is all we need to replicate $3,000 Microsoft HoloLens or Apple's future $3,000 headset. However, ARHeadsetKit costs $0 and you can try it now.

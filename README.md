This repository is for exploring the feasibility of "ARHeadsetKit 2.0", rewriting ARHeadsetKit from the ground up. The driving use case is an interactive design environment for [molecular nanotechnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_nanotechnology), building on my work in [molecular-renderer](https://github.com/philipturner/molecular-renderer). This is the perfect application for AR - physically grabbing atoms and placing them, immersing yourself in the nanostructure. Rendering the MD simulation with a speed adjusted for scaling laws, to show how it's just as fast as macroscale mechanical machines.

However, this is hypothetical, and there is no guarantee I will update ARHeadsetKit. If the update does happen, it will be in the far future. For questions or concerns, please open an issue in the main [ARHeadsetKit](https://github.com/philipturner/arheadsetkit) repository.
